Service Endpoints
-----------------

## General User Information API

General or non-account-specific informational API calls.

```

### hasrole

`GET /doecodeapi/services/user/hasrole/{role}`

Authenticated end point, determines whether or not the currently logged-in User has
the specified role code.

> Request:

> GET /doecodeapi/services/user/hasrole/ROLE
> Content-Type: application/json
> Authorization: Basic myapikey
> ```

### getsitecode

`GET /doecodeapi/services/user/getsitecode/{email}`

Determine the site code associated with a given email address, or whether or not it will be considered a "Contractor" ("CONTR") account.

> Request:
```html
GET /doecodeapi/services/user/getsitecode/myaddress@domain.com
```
> Response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{"email":"myaddress@domain.com","site_code":"CONTR"}
```

## User Session Management

API calls to manage user session state; log in and out of authenticated sessions.

### login

 `POST /doecodeapi/services/user/login`

Logs a user session into DOE CODE.  User account must be verified and active to successfully log in.  Primarily intended to support client front-end and 
HTTP session management.   Requests may log in via email and password OR confirmation code (in case of forgotten passwords) for one-time token use.
Repeated login attempts via password authentication WILL result in the account being locked. 
Locked accounts will receive an email message indicating administrative intervention is required to
unlock the account.  Additionally, if the password expiration date is due, the login will fail, and
a password change will be required to proceed.

> Request:
```
POST /doecodeapi/services/user/login
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{ "email":"myaccount@domain.com", "password":"mypassword" }
```

> Response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{"email":"myaccount@domain.com",
 "xsrfToken":"some-token-value",
 "site":"CONTR",
 "roles":["role1", "role2"],
 "pending_roles":["role3"],
 "first_name":"User",
 "last_name":"Name"}
```

<p id='user-services-login-block'>
The returned JSON object will include the user's email address, first and last name,
a site code (or "CONTR" if contractor), and an array of role codes, if any, along 
with an "xsrfToken" value for protection against cross-site request forgery attempts.  This token
value should be transmitted back with each subsequent API request when using DOE CODE services
in conjunction with a web-based UI or user login methods.
